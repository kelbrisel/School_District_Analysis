# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose: 
After generating a high level snapshot of ***PyCity School District*** key metrics, the district has identified inconsistencies with 9th grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School (THS). Original analysis is provided with amended results (replacing scores at THS, to maintain integrity of the data). 

### Overview of analysis:
The process of analyzing the PyCity School District data included several steps prior to compiling the final results, which included: cleaning the raw data (missing vales, incorrect data, and formatting), summarizing with DataFrames by school (Student Count, Budget Per Student, Score Averages, Passing Percentages), Utilizing DataFrames to Group Schools (by School Spending Per Student, School Size, School Type). 



### Results:

Summary of the school data schools significant score differences regarding Thomas High School Passing Percentages in Reading and therefore Overall Passing Percentages

# Summary:
Although the amended results are more accurate, there is little change to the analysis by removing THS discrepencies. 

## Key Findings
* Scores of charter schools are higher than District. 
* Large schools scores are lower than middle or small sized schools. 
* Increased spending per student does not correlate to higher scores.
